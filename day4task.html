        <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup
            language used to create and design
            the structure of web pages. It is the backbone of most web content, providing a
            set of elements or tags that
            define the various components and their relationships within a document. HTML allows developers to
            organize
            and present information on the internet, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia.

            HTML documents consist of a series of elements, each represented by a tag
            enclosed in angle brackets. These
            tags define the structure and content of the page. For example, the

            head tag typically contains meta-information about the document, such as the title and linked
            stylesheets,
            while the

            body tag contains the main content.

        <ul>
            <li>HTML was conceived by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in 1989 at CERN (European
                Organization for Nuclear Research). In 1990, he drafted the first proposal for what would become HTML.
            </li>

            <li>The first version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was published in 1991. It included a basic set of tags for
                structuring documents, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, and links. This early version laid the
                foundation for the web as we know it today.

            </li>

            <li>
                HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 and introduced new features like tables, form elements, and text
                alignment. This version marked the beginning of standardization efforts for HTML.
            </li>

            <li>
                HTML 3.2, released in 1997, included additional features such as applets, text formatting options, and
                support for tables and forms. This version aimed to bring consistency to web development.
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML 4.01, released in 1999, further refined the language and introduced style sheets, scripting, and
                improved support for multimedia elements. It was a significant step towards separating content and
                presentation.
            </li>
            <li>
                XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) 1.0, released in 2000, marked a move towards XML
                compatibility. It was designed to be more strict and adherent to XML syntax rules.
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML5, the latest major revision of HTML, was finalized as a W3C Recommendation in 2014. It introduced
                numerous new features and improvements, including native support for audio and video, new structural
                elements (such as <section> and <article>), and enhanced support for forms and APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlike previous versions, HTML5 is considered a "living standard," meaning it continues to evolve with
                regular updates and improvements. This approach allows for more flexibility and quicker adaptation to
                changing web technologies.
            </li>
